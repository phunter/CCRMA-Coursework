I included several classes from LibST taken from CS148, because at the time I didn't realize that SFML had similar classes already implemented.

Somehow I couldn't get Mip-mapping to work! Whenever I enabled everything rendered became totally dark. I posted a question on Piazza but no one could help me out so I left it without.

Alas! Shadow mapping never made it into the submission. This is a terrible shame :(
